          My name is Angela Raphael and this is a short story about my love for
          technology.....
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I always thought I'd be a medical personnel; help treat patients,
          examine and analyze body fluids, tissues and cells, identify
          potentially harmful microorganisms and all those other things.
          <br />It did seem like it was going to be <b>'It'</b> given my
          <em>Higher National Diploma in Microbiology</em>. Even during NYSC, I
          served in a medical facility. And then the 2020
          <em>Coronavirus</em> pandemic did hit. Everyone was compelled to stay
          home and of course, we all got bored and were on the lookout for
          things to keep ourselves busy. That's when it happened. <br />Always
          being on the net and the increased tech awareness online during those
          times, one could hardly turn a blind eye and so I decided to see what
          all the fuss was about.<br /><br />
          With absolutely no idea where to start, I randomly explored a couple
          of tech fields; from <em>non-coding</em> to coding(Frontend), where I
          finally laid my tent. It did seem like a struggle and a mismatch at
          first due to my educational background but I however got really
          intrigued by the different Technologies, how the web functions and I
          was also able to recognize the opportunities the field presented.
        </p>

          Fast-forward, It's been a progressive learning curve with online
          resources, attending bootcamps and internships in reputable firms like
          <b>Stutern</b>. I have really learnt a lot and love it whenever I get
          to apply the skills. It really is satisfying.

        <p><b>The main difference between the padding and margin is:</b></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Padding</b> defines the space between the content and the border of
          an element and is affected by the <em>styling</em> of an
          <em>element</em>, such as background color. <br />
          <b>Padding</b> does not allow negative values and we cannot set the
          padding to auto.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b> Border</b> refers to the perimeter of the box or <em>element</em>.
          <br /><b>Borders</b> can be invisible or they could be a thick colored
          line.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Margin</b> is the space outside the <em>border</em>. Styling of an
          <em>element</em> such as background color does not affect the
          <em>margin</em>.<br />
          It can be negative or any float number and we can set the
          <em>margin</em> to auto.
